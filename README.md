# üöÄ Agentic AI Workshop - AutoGen

A comprehensive workshop for exploring Microsoft AutoGen - the multi-agent conversational AI framework.

## üéØ Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed to provide a deep dive into AutoGen, Microsoft's powerful framework for building multi-agent conversational AI systems. You'll learn how to create individual agents, build complex multi-agent systems, and integrate AutoGen with external tools and services.

## üìã Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022
- Basic knowledge of C# programming
- OpenAI API key or Azure OpenAI Service access
- Git (for cloning repositories)

## üöÄ What is AutoGen?

![autogen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-3-1024x679.png)

AutoGen is a framework that enables the creation of applications using multiple AI agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. It simplifies the orchestration of complex workflows by allowing agents to:

- Collaborate and communicate with each other
- Execute code and validate results
- Integrate with external tools and APIs
- Maintain conversation context and memory
- Support both chat-based and workflow-based interactions

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Conversations**: Create systems where multiple AI agents collaborate
- **Code Execution**: Built-in support for executing and validating code
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Seamless integration of human feedback and oversight
- **Extensible**: Easy integration with external tools and APIs
- **Flexible**: Support for various LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, etc.)

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AgenticWorkshop-AutoGen.git
cd AgenticWorkshop-AutoGen
```

### 2. Install .NET SDK
Download and install the latest .NET 8.0 SDK from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### 3. Set Up API Keys
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_openai_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
```

### 4. Verify Installation
```bash
dotnet --version
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

1. Navigate to Lab 01:
   ```bash
   cd src/lab01
   ```

2. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Run the first example:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## üìñ Workshop Flow

1. **Start with Lab 01** to understand AutoGen fundamentals
2. **Progress to Lab 02** for multi-agent system development
3. **Explore Lab 03** for visual development with AutoGen Studio
4. **Complete Lab 04** for advanced integrations with MCP

Each lab builds upon the previous one, so it's recommended to follow the sequential order.
