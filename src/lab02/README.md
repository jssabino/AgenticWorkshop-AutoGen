## üìö Code Walkthrough

### Multi-Agent System Setup
```csharp
// Create specialized agents
var codeWriter = new AssistantAgent(
    name: "CodeWriter",
    systemMessage: "You are an expert software developer...",
    llmConfig: openAIConfig);

var codeReviewer = new AssistantAgent(
    name: "CodeReviewer", 
    systemMessage: "You are a senior code reviewer...",
    llmConfig: openAIConfig);

var projectManager = new AssistantAgent(
    name: "ProjectManager",
    systemMessage: "You are a project manager...",
    llmConfig: openAIConfig);
```

### Group Chat Management
```csharp
var groupChat = new GroupChat(
    agents: new[] { codeWriter, codeReviewer, projectManager },
    messages: new List<IMessage>(),
    maxRound: 10);

var groupChatManager = new GroupChatManager(
    groupChat: groupChat,
    llmConfig: openAIConfig);
```

## üîß Deep Dive: Multi-Agent Communication

### Communication Patterns

#### 1. Sequential Pattern
Agents take turns in a predefined order:
```
User ‚Üí Agent A ‚Üí Agent B ‚Üí Agent C ‚Üí User
```

#### 2. Hub-and-Spoke Pattern
Central agent coordinates with multiple specialized agents:
```
       Agent B
         ‚Üë
User ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Agent C
         ‚Üì
       Agent D
```

#### 3. Collaborative Pattern
Multiple agents work together on a shared task:
```
Agent A ‚Üî Agent B
   ‚Üï       ‚Üï
Agent C ‚Üî Agent D
```

### Message Routing
AutoGen provides several strategies for message routing:

#### 1. Round Robin
```csharp
var groupChat = new GroupChat(
    agents: agents,
    messages: messages,
    speakerSelectionMethod: SpeakerSelectionMethod.RoundRobin);
```

#### 2. Manual Selection
```csharp
var groupChat = new GroupChat(
    agents: agents,
    messages: messages,
    speakerSelectionMethod: SpeakerSelectionMethod.Manual);
```

#### 3. Auto Selection
```csharp
var groupChat = new GroupChat(
    agents: agents,
    messages: messages,
    speakerSelectionMethod: SpeakerSelectionMethod.Auto);
```

### Agent Coordination Mechanisms

#### 1. Shared Context
All agents have access to the conversation history:
```csharp
public class SharedContextAgent : AssistantAgent
{
    private readonly ConversationHistory _sharedHistory;
    
    public SharedContextAgent(ConversationHistory sharedHistory) 
    {
        _sharedHistory = sharedHistory;
    }
}
```

#### 2. State Management
Agents can maintain and share state:
```csharp
public class StatefulAgent : AssistantAgent
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, object> _sharedState;
    
    public void UpdateState(string key, object value)
    {
        _sharedState[key] = value;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Event-Driven Communication
Agents can react to events from other agents:
```csharp
public class EventDrivenAgent : AssistantAgent
{
    public event EventHandler<AgentEventArgs> TaskCompleted;
    
    protected virtual void OnTaskCompleted(AgentEventArgs e)
    {
        TaskCompleted?.Invoke(this, e);
    }
}
```

## üõ† Practical Examples

### Example 1: Code Development Team
A team of agents working together to develop software:

- **Product Owner**: Defines requirements
- **Developer**: Writes code
- **Code Reviewer**: Reviews and suggests improvements
- **Tester**: Creates test cases

### Example 2: Research Team
A team conducting research on a topic:

- **Research Lead**: Coordinates research direction
- **Data Analyst**: Analyzes data and statistics
- **Writer**: Synthesizes findings into reports
- **Critic**: Provides critical feedback

### Example 3: Customer Support Team
A team handling customer inquiries:

- **Intake Agent**: Receives and categorizes requests
- **Technical Expert**: Handles technical issues
- **Account Manager**: Manages account-related queries
- **Escalation Manager**: Handles complex cases

## üß™ Advanced Topics

### 1. Dynamic Agent Creation
Create agents on-demand based on requirements:

```csharp
public class AgentFactory
{
    public IAgent CreateAgent(AgentType type, string specialization)
    {
        return type switch
        {
            AgentType.Developer => new DeveloperAgent(specialization),
            AgentType.Reviewer => new ReviewerAgent(specialization),
            AgentType.Manager => new ManagerAgent(specialization),
            _ => throw new ArgumentException($"Unknown agent type: {type}")
        };
    }
}
```

### 2. Agent Workflows
Define complex workflows with multiple stages:

```csharp
public class WorkflowOrchestrator
{
    public async Task<WorkflowResult> ExecuteWorkflow(WorkflowDefinition workflow)
    {
        foreach (var stage in workflow.Stages)
        {
            var stageResult = await ExecuteStage(stage);
            if (!stageResult.Success)
            {
                return new WorkflowResult { Success = false, Error = stageResult.Error };
            }
        }
        return new WorkflowResult { Success = true };
    }
}
```

### 3. Agent Performance Monitoring
Monitor agent performance and behavior:

```csharp
public class AgentMonitor
{
    public void MonitorAgent(IAgent agent)
    {
        agent.MessageSent += (sender, args) => LogMessage(args);
        agent.MessageReceived += (sender, args) => LogMessage(args);
        agent.ErrorOccurred += (sender, args) => LogError(args);
    }
}
```

Prevent agents from talking indefinitely:
- Set maximum conversation rounds
- Implement termination conditions
- Use conversation moderators

#### 3. Performance Issues

- Optimize LLM API calls

#### 4. Context Management
Handle large conversation contexts:
- Implement conversation summarization
- Use selective context retention
- Implement context compression techniques

## üèÜ Best Practices
