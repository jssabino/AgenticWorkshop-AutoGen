# AutoGen Workshop - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### Q: What is AutoGen?
**A:** AutoGen is Microsoft's framework for building multi-agent conversational AI systems. It enables the creation of applications where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve complex tasks through conversation.

### Q: Do I need programming experience to use AutoGen?
**A:** While programming experience helps, AutoGen offers multiple approaches:
- **Code-based**: Requires C# or Python knowledge (Labs 01-02, 04)
- **Visual**: AutoGen Studio provides a no-code interface (Lab 03)
- **Hybrid**: Combine both approaches for maximum flexibility

### Q: What are the system requirements?
**A:** 
- **.NET Labs**: .NET 8.0 SDK, Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022
- **AutoGen Studio**: Python 3.8+, Node.js 18+
- **API Access**: OpenAI API key or Azure OpenAI Service
- **Lab 04**: GitHub account and personal access token

## Setup and Installation

### Q: I'm getting API key errors. What should I check?
**A:** Verify the following:
1. **API Key Format**: Ensure the key is correctly formatted
2. **Environment Variables**: Check that your `.env` file is properly configured
3. **Permissions**: Verify your API key has the necessary permissions
4. **Quotas**: Check if you've exceeded your API usage limits
5. **Region**: Ensure the model is available in your region

### Q: How do I get an OpenAI API key?
**A:** 
1. Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Add billing information if required

### Q: Can I use Azure OpenAI instead of OpenAI?
**A:** Yes! Azure OpenAI is fully supported. Configure your `.env` file with:
```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-01
```

### Q: AutoGen Studio won't start. What should I do?
**A:** Try these troubleshooting steps:
1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure you have Python 3.8+
2. **Port Issues**: Try a different port: `autogenstudio ui --port 8082`
3. **Dependencies**: Reinstall: `pip uninstall autogenstudio && pip install autogenstudio`
4. **Permissions**: Run with appropriate permissions
5. **Firewall**: Check if your firewall is blocking the port

## Lab-Specific Questions

### Lab 01: Introduction to AutoGen

**Q: The agent isn't responding. What's wrong?**
**A:** Check these common issues:
- API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
- Network connectivity to OpenAI/Azure OpenAI
- Model name is correct (e.g., "gpt-4", not "GPT-4")
- Sufficient API credits/quota remaining

**Q: How do I customize the agent's personality?**
**A:** Modify the `systemMessage` parameter when creating the agent:
```csharp
var agent = new OpenAIChatAgent(
    chatClient: chatClient,
    name: "Assistant",
    systemMessage: "You are a helpful coding assistant specialized in C#..."
);
```

### Lab 02: Multi-Agent Systems

**Q: Agents are talking in circles. How do I stop infinite loops?**
**A:** Implement termination conditions:
- Set maximum conversation rounds
- Use termination keywords
- Implement conversation moderators
- Add timeout mechanisms

**Q: How do I control which agent speaks next?**
**A:** Use different speaker selection methods:
- **Round Robin**: Agents take turns in order
- **Manual**: Explicitly specify the next speaker
- **Auto**: Let the system decide based on context

**Q: Can agents have different personalities?**
**A:** Absolutely! Give each agent a unique system message that defines their role, expertise, and communication style.

### Lab 03: AutoGen Studio

**Q: I can't import agent configurations. What's wrong?**
**A:** Ensure:
- JSON files are valid (check for syntax errors)
- All required fields are present
- File paths are accessible
- You have proper permissions

**Q: How do I share workflows between team members?**
**A:** Export workflows as JSON files:
1. Go to Workflows → Export
2. Share the JSON file
3. Team members can import via Workflows → Import

**Q: Can I backup my Studio configurations?**
**A:** Yes, regularly export:
- Agent configurations
- Workflow definitions
- Settings and preferences
- Store in version control (without API keys)

### Lab 04: MCP Integration

**Q: The GitHub MCP server won't start. What should I check?**
**A:** Verify:
1. **Node.js Version**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
2. **MCP Installation**: Run `npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
3. **GitHub Token**: Set `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable
4. **Token Permissions**: Ensure token has required scopes (repo, issues, etc.)
5. **Port Availability**: Check if port 3000 is available

**Q: What GitHub permissions do I need for the MCP server?**
**A:** Create a personal access token with these scopes:
- `repo` (for repository access)
- `issues` (for issue management)
- `pull_requests` (for PR operations)
- `contents` (for file operations)

**Q: How do I add custom MCP tools?**
**A:** 
1. Create a custom MCP server
2. Implement the tool functions
3. Register the tools with your agents
4. Configure the MCP client to use your server

## Performance and Optimization

### Q: My agents are responding slowly. How can I improve performance?
**A:** Try these optimizations:
- Use faster models (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo vs gpt-4)
- Reduce `max_tokens` for shorter responses
- Implement response caching
- Optimize system messages for brevity
- Use parallel processing where possible

### Q: I'm hitting API rate limits. What should I do?
**A:** Implement rate limiting strategies:
- Add delays between API calls
- Use exponential backoff for retries
